# Stock-Price-Predictor
This Project utilises LSTM neural networks to predict stock prices. It fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance, scales the data, trains the model on historical stock prices, and tests the model's accuracy. It then visualises actual and predicted stock prices and forecasts the next day's closing stock price. The LSTM architecture enables sequential data analysis and prediction, while data scaling helps in model training and result interpretation.
